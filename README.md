# CritSounds 1.4
Welcome to the experimental 1.4 tModLoader Crit Sounds repository!

This repository contains a version of Crit Sounds tempered for the upcoming 1.4 tModLoader release.

Currently uses in-game sounds instead of packed-in ones for non-custom crits.
Custom crits seem to work absolutely fine.
Enumeration currently not updated for vanilla 1.4
Additional codecs removed. As fun as implementing them was, the general consensus even amongst the tModLoader devs seems that it's an absolutely worthless addition.
