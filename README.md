# CritSounds_Experimental
Welcome to the experimental Crit Sounds repository!

This repository contains an unstable version Crit Sounds. You can freely download or even contribute to the mod, but be wary of bugs and terrible code.

Current version is v1.2.0, main feature of which is custom sound support.
To add custom crit sounds to your game, launch the game with the mod at least once, then find your tModLoader's folder in Documents. A folder named "Crit Sounds" should appear. Add any number of BASS-supported files in any of the folders, and that's it!
Sound lists refresh in-game after saving and quitting. Chat command seems to not function right now.

Version 1.2.0 requires mp3-free BASS.dll available from Un4seen Developments' website or the release page. 

Audio resources are not included.

Convenience F.A.Q!

## How do I add custom sounds?
After the first game launch with the mod installed, a new folder should appear where your tModLoader's documents folder is located (e.g. Documents/My Games/Terraria/tModLoader). A folder named "Crit Sounds" should appear. Inside of "Custom" are various folders with category names. Simply drop your audio files inside of these folders, and that's it!

## The mod does not work!
This mod requires that you have BASE.dll installed in your game folder (that means, the same folder where Terraria.exe is located). Please make sure that BASS.dll has been properly installed.

## Sounds do not play!
Either the sounds you installed are not supported by BASE (please check out Un4seen's website for supported audio codecs), or something has gone awry in the decoding process. It might also be because of my terrible coding and might be fixed in a future experimental release.

## Can I contribute to the mod in any way?
Yes! If you're a proficient modder and have noticed an error in my code, or simply wish to contribute to the code with your own features or optimizations, feel free to do so!
