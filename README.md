# CritSounds 1.4
Welcome to the experimental 1.4 tModLoader Crit Sounds repository!

This repository contains a version of Crit Sounds tempered for the stable 1.4 tModLoader branch.

# Current major changes

Enumeration removed. Mod now purely DamageClass-based.

Additional codecs removed. As fun as implementing them was, the general consensus even amongst the tModLoader devs seems that it's an absolutely worthless addition.
